==============================
Using a shared build directory
==============================

For builds that take a long time, it can be convenient to reuse them across
several buildouts. To do this, use the `shared` option:

    >>> cache = tmpdir('cache')
    >>> write('buildout.cfg',
    ... """
    ... [buildout]
    ... parts = foo
    ... download-cache = %s
    ...
    ... [foo]
    ... recipe = zc.recipe.cmmi
    ... url = file://%s/foo.tgz
    ... shared = True
    ... """ % (cache, distros))

When run the first time, the build is executed as usual:

    >>> print system('bin/buildout')
    Installing foo.
    foo: Unpacking and configuring
    configuring foo /cache/cmmi/build/...
    echo building foo
    building foo
    echo installing foo
    installing foo
    <BLANKLINE>

But after that, the existing shared build directory is used instead of running
the build again:

    >>> remove('.installed.cfg')
    >>> print system('bin/buildout')
    Installing foo.
    foo: using existing shared build
    <BLANKLINE>


The shared directory
====================

By default, the shared build directory is named with a hash of the recipe's
configuration options (but it can also be configured manually, see below):

    >>> ls(cache, 'cmmi', 'build')
    d  ...

For example, if the download url changes, the build is executed again:

    >>> import os
    >>> import shutil
    >>> shutil.copy(os.path.join(distros, 'foo.tgz'),
    ...             os.path.join(distros, 'qux.tgz'))

    >>> remove('.installed.cfg')
    >>> write('buildout.cfg',
    ... """
    ... [buildout]
    ... parts = qux
    ... download-cache = %s
    ...
    ... [qux]
    ... recipe = zc.recipe.cmmi
    ... url = file://%s/qux.tgz
    ... shared = True
    ... """ % (cache, distros))
    >>> print system('bin/buildout')
    Installing qux.
    qux: Unpacking and configuring
    configuring foo /cache/cmmi/build/...
    echo building foo
    building foo
    echo installing foo
    installing foo

and another shared directory is created:

    >>> ls(cache, 'cmmi', 'build')
    d  ...
    d  ...

(Other recipes can retrieve the shared build directory from our part's
`location` as usual, so the SHA-names shouldn't be a problem.)


Configuring the shared directory
================================

If you set `shared` to an existing directory, that will be used as the build
directory directly (instead of a name computed from to the recipe options):

    >>> shared = os.path.join(cache, 'existing')
    >>> os.mkdir(shared)
    >>> write('buildout.cfg',
    ... """
    ... [buildout]
    ... parts = foo
    ...
    ... [foo]
    ... recipe = zc.recipe.cmmi
    ... url = file://%s/foo.tgz
    ... shared = %s
    ... """ % (distros, shared))

    >>> remove('.installed.cfg')
    >>> print system('bin/buildout')
    Installing foo.
    foo: Unpacking and configuring
    configuring foo /cache/existing/cmmi
    echo building foo
    building foo
    echo installing foo
    installing foo
    <BLANKLINE>

If no download-cache is set, and `shared` is not a directory, an error is raised:

    >>> write('buildout.cfg',
    ... """
    ... [buildout]
    ... parts = foo
    ...
    ... [foo]
    ... recipe = zc.recipe.cmmi
    ... url = file://%s/foo.tgz
    ... shared = True
    ... """ % distros)

    >>> print system('bin/buildout')
    While:
      Installing.
      Getting section foo.
      Initializing part foo.
    ...
    ValueError:  Set the 'shared' option of zc.recipe.cmmi to an existing
    directory, or set ${buildout:download-cache}


Build errors
============

If an error occurs during the build (or it is aborted by the user),
the build directory is removed, so there is no risk of accidentally
mistaking some half-baked build directory as a good cached shared build.

Let's simulate a build error. First, we backup a working build.

    >>> shutil.copy(os.path.join(distros, 'foo.tgz'),
    ...             os.path.join(distros, 'foo.tgz.bak'))

Then we create a broken tarball:

    >>> import tarfile
    >>> import StringIO
    >>> import sys
    >>> tarpath = os.path.join(distros, 'foo.tgz')
    >>> tar = tarfile.open(tarpath, 'w:gz')
    >>> configure = 'invalid'
    >>> info = tarfile.TarInfo('configure')
    >>> info.size = len(configure)
    >>> info.mode = 0755
    >>> tar.addfile(info, StringIO.StringIO(configure))

Now we reset the cache to force our broken tarball to be used:

    >>> shutil.rmtree(cache)
    >>> cache = tmpdir('cache')
    >>> write('buildout.cfg',
    ... """
    ... [buildout]
    ... parts = foo
    ... download-cache = %s
    ...
    ... [foo]
    ... recipe = zc.recipe.cmmi
    ... url = file://%s/foo.tgz
    ... shared = True
    ... """ % (cache, distros))

    >>> remove('.installed.cfg')
    >>> res = system('bin/buildout')
    >>> print res
    Installing foo.
    ...
    ValueError: Couldn't find configure

The temporary directory where tarball was unpacked was left behind for
debugging purposes.

    >>> import re
    >>> shutil.rmtree(re.search('foo: cmmi failed: (.*)', res).group(1))

When we now fix the error (by copying back the working version and resetting the
cache), the build will be run again, and we don't use a half-baked shared
directory:

    >>> shutil.copy(os.path.join(distros, 'foo.tgz.bak'),
    ...             os.path.join(distros, 'foo.tgz'))
    >>> shutil.rmtree(cache)
    >>> cache = tmpdir('cache')
    >>> write('buildout.cfg',
    ... """
    ... [buildout]
    ... parts = foo
    ... download-cache = %s
    ...
    ... [foo]
    ... recipe = zc.recipe.cmmi
    ... url = file://%s/foo.tgz
    ... shared = True
    ... """ % (cache, distros))
    >>> print system('bin/buildout')
    Installing foo.
    foo: Unpacking and configuring
    configuring foo /cache/cmmi/build/...
    echo building foo
    building foo
    echo installing foo
    installing foo
    <BLANKLINE>


Regression: Keeping track of a reused shared build
==================================================

zc.recipe.cmmi 1.2 had a bug that manifested when reusing a shared build by a
second buildout: The part wouldn't keep track of the shared build and thus
wasn't able to restore it if it got deleted from the cache. Let's simulate the
second buildout by removing .installed.cfg, then this is how it should work:

    >>> remove('.installed.cfg')
    >>> print system('bin/buildout')
    Installing foo.
    foo: using existing shared build

    >>> rmdir(cache, 'cmmi', 'build')
    >>> print system('bin/buildout')
    Uninstalling foo.
    Installing foo.
    foo: Unpacking and configuring
    configuring foo /cache/cmmi/build/...
    echo building foo
    building foo
    echo installing foo
    installing foo


Regression: Don't leave behind a build directory if the download failed
=======================================================================

zc.recipe.cmmi up to version 1.3.1 had a bug that caused an empty build
directory to be left behind if a download failed, causing it to be mistaken
for a good shared build.

We cause the download to fail by specifying a nonsensical MD5 sum:

    >>> shutil.rmtree(cache)
    >>> cache = tmpdir('cache')
    >>> write('buildout.cfg',
    ... """
    ... [buildout]
    ... parts = foo
    ... download-cache = %s
    ...
    ... [foo]
    ... recipe = zc.recipe.cmmi
    ... url = file://%s/foo.tgz
    ... md5sum = 1234
    ... shared = True
    ... """ % (cache, distros))

    >>> remove('.installed.cfg')
    >>> print system('bin/buildout')
    Installing foo.
    ...
    Error: MD5 checksum mismatch for local resource at '/distros/foo.tgz'.

The build directory must not exist anymore:

    >>> ls(cache, 'cmmi')

Another buildout run must fail the same way as the first attempt:

    >>> print system('bin/buildout')
    Installing foo.
    ...
    Error: MD5 checksum mismatch for local resource at '/distros/foo.tgz'.
